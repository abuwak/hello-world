This repository is for practising the GitHub Flow.
I am Aadil Abuwak, I have a degree in physics and mathematics and an honours degree in physics. I just recently started a job at BrightRock insurance and would like to learn data analytics so that I can advance my career in the business. I have some knowledge of python programming as I used this in my honours project which involved doing time series analysis on astronomical data. I enjoy learning new things and solving problems.
